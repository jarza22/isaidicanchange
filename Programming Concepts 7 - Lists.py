#1: What is the output of the following print statements given this list? (4)
names = ["Scarlet", "Jazmine", "Matthew", "Miles", "Savannah",
         "Tucker", "Jamie", "Alex", "Donovin", "Mariah"]

print(names[1])
print(names[-1])
print(names[0:-1:2])
print(len(names))

#2: Write a line of code that adds your name to the end of the above list. (4)

#3: Write a line of code that removes your instructor's name from the list. (4)

#4: Loop through the above list and print each name in all caps. (4)

#5: Add up the number of letters in each name in the above list. Print the result. (4)
#This can be done with a single line of code, but a loop is acceptible.

#6: Write a Python script that repeatedly asks the user to input names, or enter "q" to finish.
#After they have finished, the script should print the names in a presentable fashion, followed by
#the length of the list total number of characters used excluding spaces, again in a presentable fashion. (20)
